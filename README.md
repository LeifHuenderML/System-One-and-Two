# System-One-and-Two
This repository is dedicated to the active development of an intelligent system designed to integrate both System 1 and System 2 thinking parameters. Our aim is to create a model that seamlessly combines intuitive, fast-thinking processes with analytical, slow-thinking capabilities, reflecting the full spectrum of human cognition.
